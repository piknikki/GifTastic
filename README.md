Gifphy API project

This project begins with a page of buttons which populate gifs from the website Giphy.  You can add topics to be searched, and see the images when you click on the button of that topic.  In addition, you can pause or play the gifs (so they're not all playing automatically and making you crazy over-stimulated).
